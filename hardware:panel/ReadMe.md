# this folder contains various CAM files and design resources.

- gerbers is, surprise, where the gerber files can be found. at this point, i'd recommend building the wm8731 version; it's more versatile. 

- the remaining stuff is mostly about panels / layout / dimensions:

  - .fpd (for use with front panel express / schaeffer)
  - .svg and .pdf (for use with whatever)
  - .fzz is a/the panel design in "fritzing" format. you'll need fritzing to edit it, adjust pot-sizes, graphics, etc
